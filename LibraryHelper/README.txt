So this should make a folder in your C: called LibraryHelperFiles.
In MyClassroom.txt enter your username(I'm still kind of wondering if this is needed) then any pictures you want to show up in your library you can just drop in the ImagesFolder.
I'm working on saving the information for each book now.
